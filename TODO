☐ #17 test all commands
  100% coverage for /tools/ (and potentially everything else)

☐ personal config:
  ☐ #10 names for packages
    Commands `mount`, `develop` (and potentially more) should accept a package name in which case the package file is searched for and the latest version found is used

  ☐ #9 personal config: directory to store newly created packages in
    So that `pack` creates the package file in the configured directory instead of in `./temp`

  ☐ #14 personal config: list of local directories having packages
    Should replace the file `Workspace/.pkgmeta/repo`

☐ #16 implement update command
  update an input to have data from

  - latest version of package
  - a concrete version of the package
  - another package

☐ #22 metadata support for branch command
  Similar to develop, but create a new package instead of version, yet somehow keep metadata about its ancestry.

  This would enable

  creating compatible fixes for old packages without confusing package timeline (although everything depending on the original would need to be branched to use the fix)
  use of template packages (e.g. tool invocations already parametrized with some databases as dependencies)

☐ #20 branding
  The current name lib from librarian fits quite well, but it is widely used in programming with another meaning.

  This project definitely has some similarity how books and periodicals are created with their identifiers being ISBN, ISSN.

  The project name should imply one or more of:
    - having resilience to manipulation
    - having stable connections
    - being peer to peer
    - related to data
    - similarity with press business
    - relaxed workflow

  Candidates:
    - hare (from HAck REcord - trail of data hacks)
    - hackpack
    - Santa's Factory
    - Santa's Workshop
