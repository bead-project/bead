P for problem
D for decision
? for undecided yet

P: separate sensitive data
D: multiple local repos
D: multiple output repos
D:
  - packages has token sets assigned
  - repos has token sets assigned
  - a package can be stored in a repo that has all of the tokens of the package
  * when destination repository is unique, it need not be specified


P: find locally available packages
D: local repos
 - a flat directory with many files
 - specially formatted directories with packages in hierarchy
   - marked at the root with a marker file "HARE-REPO" with content "basic"
   ? subdirectories containing packages have a file 'UUID' with the uuid content
      -: introduces a reserved name?


P: bijectively map package names to uuids and back
D: personal config has a name<->uuid map database, not necessarily bijective
?: local repos encode the map in the directory/file names
 -: needs further thinking how to do it
 -: easy to be corrupted manually, thus making packages unavailable
 -: extra tool to check and fix corruptions
 +: trivial discoverability of packages



P: personal config needs to be protected from crashes
?: simple config, little data, data is in the filesystem/structures
?: lots of data, sqlite3 and transactions
