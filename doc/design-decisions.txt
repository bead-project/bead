P for problem
D for decision
? for undecided yet

P: separate sensitive data
D: multiple local repos
D: multiple output repos
?:
  - packages has token sets assigned
  - repos has token sets assigned
  - a package can be stored in a repo that has all of the tokens of the package
  * when destination repository is unique, it need not be specified


P: find locally available packages
D: local repos
 - a flat directory with many files
 - specially formatted directories with packages in hierarchy
   - marked at the root with a marker file *BEADBOX-TYPE* with content "basic"


P: resolve packages via human memorizable names
D: responsibility of name-resolution is on repositories
D: use file name [fragments]
 +: trivial discoverability of packages


P: personal config needs to be protected from crashes
D: simple config, little data, data is in the filesystem/structures


P: allow renaming of packages
D: use technical name internally, that parallels and translates to/from human name[s]
D: names are part of the human interface, allow them to be ambiguous, they are not necessary for operation


P: interoperability with bagit
D: will not happen
   - it is not obvious if anyone would ever use the bagit support
   - the serialization format of bagit forces to push the content one directory deeper
     (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-13#section-4 Serialization).
     This either takes away some simplicity or the solution (known, fixed root name,
     e.g. `bead`) would slightly violate the intent of bagit spec.
   - bead code and metadata files are either put under `data` directory
     or they are stored as "unexpected" bagit tag files
