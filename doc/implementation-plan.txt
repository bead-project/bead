implementation plan

1. data package files
 - create package file from workspace
 - extract workspace from package file

2. store with unchangeable ids
 - copy data in by id -> version
 - get exact version by (id, version)
3. names over ids
 - register name for id
 - rename id
4. channels
 - Channel as interface
 - special channel TIMELINE: get latest version by name | id

5. data packages and repo
 - upload workspace as new package version
 - create workspace directly from repo

----
EXTRAS:

- verify reproducibility of packages
- extract dependency chain as graph
	- visualize dependencies
	- extract dependencies as snakefile
- tag packages
- per package channels
- lock channel with hint for continuation channel
- test channels
